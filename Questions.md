# Information that should be possible to obtain from visualization

getting global insights:
    - what nutrition grade dominates dataset?
    - what carbon footprint 100g dominates dataset?

focusing on subsets
    - information about serve size in the subset
    - information about popularity in selected purchase place (i.e. how many products of this category are purchared in this country)
    - information of carbon footprint of the subset

comparing subsets
    - comparison of countries based on how many healthy products (nutrition grade field) are purshared there (purchase place field).
    - comparison of countries based on carbon footprint of products purchared in country.
    - comparison of selected nutrition fact (e.g. energy_100g, proteins_100g, ....) for selected subset?
